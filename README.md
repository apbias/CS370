# CS370: Current/Emerging Trend in CS 

**Deep Q-Learning Treasure Hunt Game**

In this project, I developed an intelligent agent to solve a treasure hunt maze using deep Q-learning. While I was provided with the basic maze environment and experience storage functionality, my main contribution was implementing the core Q-learning algorithm that enables the agent to learn and navigate effectively. This involved creating a balance between exploration and exploitation, developing a reward system, and optimizing the neural network's learning process.

This experience exemplified how computer scientists approach complex problems - breaking them down into manageable components and developing systematic solutions. Rather than attempting to solve the entire maze navigation problem at once, I focused on individual elements: how the agent observes its environment, how it makes decisions, and how it learns from experience. This methodical approach, combined with continuous testing and refinement, led to an effective solution that achieved a 100% win rate.

The ethical implications of this work also became clear throughout development. As computer scientists, we have a responsibility to create systems that are not only effective but also transparent and reliable. This means ensuring our AI's decision-making process is understandable, documenting our code clearly for future developers, and considering the efficient use of computational resources. These considerations shape how we approach problem-solving and ultimately impact the users who rely on our solutions.
